# Welcome to learn python!



a = 3 # assign the value (interget) in the veriable a 
b = 3 # same assign the value (interget) in the veriable b


# Now here use the if condition

if a>b: # here if this condition will false (mean if a not less the b) then the *else* condition will run.
	print(f'{a} is less then {b}') # printing our massage if this condition will true.


elif a==b: # here we are checkig  that if (a is equal to b) then print the mass 
	print(f'{a} equal to {b}') # printing our mass if this condition will equal



else: # else condition checking that if a not less the b then it would print that mass in else operation or (if condition would true then if would print the mass whatever in the if contion we are giving)
	print(f'{a} is not less then {b}') # printing our massage if this condition will false


# OUTPUT
# 3 equal to 3
