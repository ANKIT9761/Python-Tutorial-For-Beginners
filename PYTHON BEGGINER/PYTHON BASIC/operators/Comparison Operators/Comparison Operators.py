# Hello! Welcome :)

c = 44 
d = 34 

print(c==d) # Equal to operators
print(c!=d) # Not Equal to operators
print(c>d) # Greater then operators
print(c<d) # less then operators
print(c<=d) # less then equal operators
print(c>=d) # greater then equal operators



# Output


# False
# True
# True
# False
# False
# True

# The output the givin the bool value becaue it is Comparison Operators
