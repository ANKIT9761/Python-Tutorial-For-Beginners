- if condition

- The most common type of flow control statement is the if statement. An if statement’s clause (that is, the block following the if statement) will execute if the statement’s condition is True. The clause is skipped if the condition is False.

	* In plain English, an if statement could be read as, “If this condition is true, execute the code in 	  	  the clause.” In Python, an if statement consists of the following:


	
--> The if keyword
--> A condition (that is, an expression that evaluates to True or False)
--> A colon
--> Starting on the next line, an indented block of code (called the if clause)


Example!,
	For example, let’s say you have some code that checks to see whether someone’s name is Alice. (Pretend 		name was assigned some value earlier.)
	

	if name == 'Alice':
    		print('Hi, Alice.')
