# Welcome to learn python!



a = 3 # assign the value (interget) in the veriable a 
b = 9 # same assign the value (interget) in the veriable b


# Now here use the if condition

if a<b: # Here we are checking that a less then b (if this will True and the com will print he whatever massage we are printing) and if this condition is gona to be False then if would not print any thing because we are only using the if not use the else. 
	print(f'{a} is less then {b}') # printing our massage if this condition will true.



# OUTPUT

# 3 is less then 9
